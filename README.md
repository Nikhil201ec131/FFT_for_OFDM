# FFT_for_OFDM
The objective of the project is to design a 64-point Fast Fourier Transform chip using Verilog. The 64-point FFT is realized by decomposing it into a two-dimensional structure of 8-point FFTs.
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm used to quickly calculate the Discrete 
Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence of digital samples. The DFT is a mathematical 
transformation that converts a sequence of time-domain samples into its frequencydomain representation.
In Digital communication, FFT is used in many applications such as modulation, 
demodulation, channel equalization, and spectrum analysis. One of the most 
important applications of FFT in digital communication is in Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems.
Fourth and fifth generation wireless and mobile systems are currently the focus of 
research and development. Broadband wireless systems based on orthogonal 
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) will allow packet- based high-data-rate 
communication suitable for video transmission and mobile Internet applications. 
The IEEE standard defines the principal functions and architecture of such a highdata-rate communication system. Apart from the high speed of operation, the
system demands low power consumption since it is primarily aimed at portable and 
mobile applications. A general purpose DSP with associated software is not
beneficial for this application since on average, the power consumption of a 
software solution is an order of magnitude higher compared to a functionally 
equivalent dedicated hardware solution
